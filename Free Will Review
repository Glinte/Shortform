Just read [free will](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/free-will-solution), really disappointed.

*   not many interesting insights.
    *   a couple posts on determinism, ok but I already believed it
    *   some unrelated stuff: causality, thinking without notion of time... these are actually interesting but not needed
    *   moral consequence of 'no free will': I disregard the notion of moral responsibility
        *   EY having really strong sense of morality makes everything worse
*   low quality discussions: people keep attacking strawmans
